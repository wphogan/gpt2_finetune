TARGET TEXT: Human aspartic protease memapsin 2 cleaves the beta-secretase site of beta-amyloid precursor protein. The cDNAs of two new human membrane-associated aspartic proteases, memapsin 1 and memapsin 2, have been cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences show that each contains the typical pre, pro, and aspartic protease regions, but each also has a C-terminal extension of over 80 residues, which includes a single transmembrane domain and a C-terminal cytosolic domain. Memapsin 2 mRNA is abundant in human brain. The protease domain of memapsin 2 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified. Recombinant memapsin 2 specifically hydrolyzed peptides derived from the beta-secretase site of both the wild-type and Swedish mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-amyloid precursor protein) with over 60-fold increase of catalytic efficiency for the latter. Expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein and memapsin 2 in HeLa cells showed that memapsin 2 cleaved the beta-secretase site of beta-amyloid precursor protein intracellularly. These and other results suggest that memapsin 2 fits all of the criteria of beta-secretase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the in vivo production of the beta-amyloid (beta-amyloid) peptide leading to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Recombinant memapsin 2 also cleaved a peptide derived from the processing site of presenilin 1, albeit with poor kinetic efficiency. Alignment of cleavage site sequences of peptides indicates that the specificity of memapsin 2 resides mainly at the S(1)' subsite, which prefers small side chains such as Ala, Ser, and Asp.<|endoftext|>

TARGET TEXT: Cutting edge: combined treatment of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma causes redistribution of junctional adhesion molecule in human endothelial cells. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma induce cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells and promote transmigration of leukocytes across endothelial cells. However, when those two were administered together, leukocyte transmigration paradoxically decreased. We cloned a human and bovine homologue of the junctional adhesion molecule (junctional adhesion molecule), a novel molecule at the tight junction, and examined the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on junctional adhesion molecule in HUVECs. The combined treatment of TNF-alpha plus IFN-gamma caused a disappearance of junctional adhesion molecule from intercellular junctions. However, flow cytometry, cell ELISA, and subcellular fractionation analysis demonstrated that the amount of junctional adhesion molecule was not reduced. This suggested that junctional adhesion molecule changed its distribution in response to proinflammatory cytokines. This redistribution of junctional adhesion molecule might be involved in a decrease in transendothelial migration of leukocytes at inflammatory sites.<|endoftext|>

TARGET TEXT: Localization of a human nucleoporin 155 gene (nucleoporin 155 gene) to the 5p13 region and cloning of its cDNA. Nucleoporins are the main components of nuclear pore complexes (nuclear pore complexes) involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Starting with an expressed DNA fragment retrieved by exon trapping from pooled human BAC clones mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5, we identified a human nucleoporin cDNA sequence by PCR from a human testis cDNA library. The coding sequence showed high homology to that of the rat nucleoporin 155 (nucleoporin 155) cDNA. FISH analysis with the human BAC clone as probe localized the human nucleoporin 155 gene gene to chromosome band 5p13. Northern analysis showed that the human nucleoporin 155 gene gene was expressed at different levels in all tissues tested. Two species of transcripts were observed with estimated lengths of 5.4 and 4.7 kb, respectively, in concordance with the finding of two alternative polyadenylation sites in the cDNA. The genomic location of the human nucleoporin 155 gene gene suggests a possible role in the mental and developmental retardation associated with hemizygous deletions of the 5p13 region.<|endoftext|>

TARGET TEXT: JAZ requires the double-stranded RNA-binding zinc finger motifs for nuclear localization. We have cloned and characterized a novel zinc finger protein, termed JAZ. JAZ contains four C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger motifs that are connected by long (28-38) amino acid linker sequences. JAZ is expressed in all tissues tested and localizes in the nucleus, primarily the nucleolus. JAZ preferentially bindouble-stranded to double-stranded (double-stranded) RNA or RNA/DNA hybridouble-stranded rather than DNA. Mutation of individual zinc finger motifs reveals that the zinc finger domains are not only essential for double-strandedRNA binding but are also required for its nucleolar localization, which demonstrates a complex trafficking mechanism dependent on the nucleic acid-binding capability of the protein. Furthermore, forced expression of JAZ potently induces apoptosis in murine fibroblast cells. Thus, JAZ may belong to a class of zinc finger proteins that features double-strandedRNA binding and may regulate cell growth via the unique double-strandedRNA binding properties.<|endoftext|>

TARGET TEXT: Early gene expression during androgen-induced inhibition of proliferation of prostate cancer cells: a new suppressor candidate on chromosome 13, in the BRCA2-retinoblastoma locus. In the prostate gland cell numbers are regulated by androgens through three separate pathways: (a) inhibition of cell death (apoptosis), (b) induction of cell proliferation (step 1), and (c) inhibition of cell proliferation (step 2, proliferative shutoff). The precise regulation of these control pathways is still elusive. The human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cell line variants express a subset of proliferative pathways comparable to those present in normal prostate cells (LNCaP-FGC expresses both steps, LNCaP-LNO expresses step 2, LNCaP-TAC expresses step 1, LNCaP-TJA expresses neither). The purpose of the present work is to identify the genes involved in the androgen-induced proliferative arrest of these cells. Using a Wang-Brown subtracted library, a set of shutoff specific genes has been isolated. One of these new genes, AS3, shows high expression in the early regulatory phase of androgen-induced proliferative shutoff in the cell variants and in the prostates of castrated rats. The putative 1391-residue polypeptide has the molecular size of about 186 kDa. It has coiled-coil structures that usually participate in protein-protein interactions, a perfect leucine-zipper that suggests DNA binding, nuclear localization motifs, proline- and serinerich domains, unique C-terminal acidic-basic repeats, and ATP- and DNA-binding motifs. The transcript has 34 exons in a 200,000 bp region on chromosome 13q12-q13, downstream of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2, and centromeric to the retinoblastoma (retinoblastoma) locus. This area is subject to frequent allelic losses in cancers, and is believed to carry a number of cryptic suppressor genes. The AS3 gene seems to be a novel candidate in the regulation of androgen-induced proliferative arrest of human prostate cells.<|endoftext|>

TARGET TEXT: An imprinted, mammalian bicistronic transcript encodes two independent proteins. Polycistronic transcripts are common in prokaryotes but rare in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis of the SNRPN (SNRPN) mRNA in five eutherian mammals reveals a second highly conserved coding sequence, termed SNRPN upstream reading frame (SNRPN upstream reading frame). The vast majority of nucleotide substitutions in SNRPN upstream reading frame occur in the wobble codon position, providing strong evolutionary evidence for selection for protein-coding function. Because SNRPN upstream reading frame-SNRPN maps to human chromosome 15q11-q13 and is paternally expressed, each cistron is a candidate for a role in the imprinted Prader-Willi syndrome (Prader-Willi syndrome) and Prader-Willi syndrome mouse models. SNRPN upstream reading frame encodes a highly basic 71-aa protein that is nuclear-localized (as is SNRPN). Because SNRPN upstream reading frame is the only protein-coding sequence within the imprinting regulatory region in 15q11-q13, it may have provided the original selection for imprinting in this domain. Whereas some human tissues express a minor SNRPN upstream reading frame-only transcript, mouse tissues express only the bicistronic Snurf-Snrpn transcript. We show that both SNRPN upstream reading frame and SNRPN are translated in normal, but not Prader-Willi syndrome, human, and mouse tissues and cell lines. These findings identify SNRPN upstream reading frame as a protein that is produced along with SNRPN from a bicistronic transcript; polycistronic mRNAs therefore are encoded in mammalian genomes where they may form functional operons.<|endoftext|>

TARGET TEXT: 3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase) interacts with human RAD23 proteins. Human 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase) initiates base excision repair by severing the glycosylic bond of numerous damaged bases. In comparison, homologues of the Rad23 proteins (homologues of the Rad23 proteins) and the hXPC protein are involved in the recognition of damaged bases in global genome repair, a subset of nucleotide excision repair. In this report, we show that the homologues of the Rad23 proteinsA and -B also interact with the 3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase and can serve as accessory proteins for DNA damage recognition in base excision repair. Furthermore, the MPG.homologues of the Rad23 proteins protein complex elevates the rate of 3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase-catalyzed excision from hypoxanthine-containing substrates. This increased excision rate is correlated with a greater binding affinity of the 3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase-homologues of the Rad23 proteins protein complex for damaged DNA. These data suggest that the homologues of the Rad23 proteins proteins function as universal DNA damage recognition accessory proteins in both of these major excision repair pathways.<|endoftext|>
